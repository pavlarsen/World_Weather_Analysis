## Overview of Project

For this project the main goal was to develop a code in Python for customers of PLANMYTRIP. The goal is to enable clients to choose a travel destination based on their desired weather temperature on their destination. The code will sort through a list of more than 500 cities in the world and showcase in Google Maps the filtered cities according to the input. The code will not only filter for cities that match the user's preferences, but it will be able to provide hotels available at the destination as well as current weather description.
